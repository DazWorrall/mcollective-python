mcollective-python
==================

This is an example Python binding for Marionette Collective RPC.

[API Documentation](http://insom.github.com/mcollective-python/)

The main class is `Message`, and you create an instance of this to initiate
some RPC. It takes a dictionary which contains the actual request (following
[the MCollective RPC documentation][rpc]) and a stomp.Client instance for
future use.

You can then .sign() a request, with your private key, .subscribe_to_replies(),
manually .send() and then .collect_results() - or just do a
.send_and_await_results() after signing to receive an array of STOMP messages
back.

Requirements
------------

* M2Crypto - seems to be the most comprehensive OpenSSL binding, though I needed
  to read the source.

* stompy - make Python speak STOMP.

And it also requires you to have particular MCollective setup:

	securityprovider = ssl
	plugin.ssl_serializer = yaml

The Quick Start
---------------

	# Run the test client
	$ python test.py localhost username password aaron-private.pem aaron-public uptime
